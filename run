# TODO write scripts:
# 1) General eval script that takes the algorthm name + parameters and
#    calls ./zehntausend accordingly
# 2) Evaluation presets for testing that calls script 1 w/ fixed values
# 3) Dedicated pplotting scripts: one default (current), one that takes
#    a stats file (or ID) as input and re-prints the graph. Output is
#    always a default file that can then be moved to the right location.
